### Keywords

Keyword research from [Wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/); the first column is volume, followed by competition and IAAT:

Wizard hat for costume:

The keywords I settled on are:
wizard hat, wizard costume, wizard hat costume, gandalf hat, gandalf costume, wizard hat adult, halloween wizard hat, wizard cosplay, good wizard costume for adults, what is a wizard costume, gandalf wizard hat, pointed wizard hat, where to get wizard hat for costume

'Gandalf' seemed like a solid choice as it was relatively high volume and low competition, and also the inspiration for the shop in the first place.

### User Needs

### Marketing Strategies

Which online platforms would you find lots of your users?

Social media - Instagram and Facebook, if the shop gains more staff could possibly reach into other platforms.

What do your users need? Could you meet that need with useful content? If yes, how could you best deliver that content to them?

Cosplay tips, costume tips, perhaps best delivered as a blog, maybe on Instagram. My video production skills/cosplay skills arenâ€™t good enough for Tiktok, so written content may be more effective.

Would your business run sales or offer discounts? How do you think your users would most like to hear about these offers?

Yes, interested in the idea of having an Instagram poll that is a battle between two wizards, and whichever one wins, a hat similar to that will be on sale for a week. Announced on other platforms as well, and ideally email as well as that seems to be most effective marketing for small-scale low-budget business. The poll will be run on Facebook and on the website (in the comments of the battle post). Mailchimp signup implemented on website footer.

What are the goals of your business? Which marketing strategies would offer the best ways to meet those goals?

The goal is to sell hats. Email marketing, in-site blog posts (battle arena) and organic social media marketing in tandem.

Would your business have a budget to spend on advertising? Or would it need to work with free or low cost options to market itself?

Low-budget as it is a small-scale and niche business, budget to be reassessed if becomes successful. The site will definitely work with email and social media.
