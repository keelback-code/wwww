### Theme, Epic and User Stories

#### Theme

To sell custom made interesting wizard hats (and other wizard associated clothing items) online.

#### Epic

This website will provide the user with an array of wizardly hats and other clothing items, products both expected and unexpected. The website will be simple and easy to use; a good experience for the user that will make their time in the shop welcoming. Each product will have Dungeons and Dragons style stats (see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic_(role-playing_games)] ), along with other variables to choose from in order to customise each product.

### Design and UX

Light text on a dark background can be very striking, but hard to parse for large amounts of text. For my navbar, footer and landing page I chose light text on a dark background as it is arresting and blends seamlessly with the background. For larger amounts of text, such as posts in the battle arena, or anything with an image that needs to be overlaid, such as the shop, I switched back to a light background with dark text to make it easier for the user to take in. To keep the dark theme throughout the website, I kept the dark background and placed the text and images on cards or card-like elements so that all pages felt unified.

The colors implemented across the site are:
Dark options: #050533
Light options: #faebd7
Anyhting requiring a third colour (such as hovering over darker links which are on a light background): #534582

### Wireframes

The size of the site grew between the initial wireframe stage and completion of the site, including the addition of the battle arena and the staff hub, which is why they are not represented here.

### Debugging and known bugs

Custom product model - I originally had my calculations in the model but it wasn't working so I changed it over to the view with help from [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29228627/djangoget-field-values-using-views-py-from-html-form):

For custom variables on these products, for pricing I was able to have separate functions and feed in variables one, two and three, but this meant in the front and back ends the actual name didnâ€™t show, so both users just saw a letter (a, b, c, etc) instead of the label. Options were to have more variables feed into the calc function, which is a bit bulky but the other option was to have all the code from the calcuation function in each class, making this file six times as long and six times as ugly. I opted for feeding 6 variables into my calculation function instead of repeating my code more than I already am.

Getting two different product models into the loot/shopping bag - originally this shop had two types of products, standard products (similar to the products in Boutique Ado) and custom products. Feeding two models into the loot function broke it immediately; I did a lot of moving around, researching and renaming, and playing with the context file as that aspect of django was new to me. I tried to put the custom products in the same function in the context file, or a different function in the same context file, or a separate context file in the same app or in a different app. I also tried parent model classes, which unfortunately also didnâ€™t work.

After a few days I decided to refocus my website as it was becoming clear that I couldn't achieve my current goal with my current skills and timeframe. I changed the shop to be only custom products.

The downside of this is that, due to the quoting system I was able to implement, there is currently no option for a staff member to add a product directly, which will be a future feature. I was able to create a cascading form which had associated models for the options and the variables, but I was unable to feed that into the quote system for customers, which is arguably more important as without customers there is no point having a shop. For this iteration, in place of staff being able to add a product directly I have a very detailed staff product submission form, to provide as many details as possible so that implementing the submission takes as little time as possible for the dev. Both the developer and staff member are emailed the details. The staff member is emailed the details in order to assure them that the form went through and it will be actioned. It is saved to the db so that the staff member can see and edit the details from the staff hub, and the dev can see the details on the back end. If the staff member edits the details, the updated details will be emailed to the staff member and the dev. A delete option is unavailable as this would be potentially disruptive to the developer's work; in it's place there is a polite message and contact details.

### Deployment

#### Publishing
The project was deployed using Heroku. The process is as follows:

Once you have signed up to Heroku, on the top right of the dashboard there is a button labelled 'New'. This will open a dropdown; please select 'Create new app'. On the next page you can choose your region and a name for the project. Then click 'Create app'.

On the next page there is a menu along the top. Navigate to 'Settings', where you will find the config vars. Scroll down to the section named 'Config vars' and click on the button labelled 'Reveal config vars'. Cloudinary (AWS?) and Postgres will both need config vars as per your own details. You will also need to set a secret key. Once the config vars are saved, back in Gitpod save them in an env.py file. Make sure to add env.py to your .gitignore list so that your config vars do not become publically available on Github.

If you scroll back to the top of the page you will find the 'Deploy' tab, which has multiple options for deployment. I used Github for this project. When you click on the Github button a bar will come up for you to search for the repo you wish to connect to.

Once you have connected, you have the option to deploy automatically (the app will update every time you push) or manually (update only when you choose). I chose automatic but you can do what suits you.

After the first push/update, your app will be ready to go!

#### Forking and Cloning

To save a copy of the code and work on it yourself, here are the steps for forking and cloning using Github:
In the repository, click the 'Fork' button, which is on the top right-hand side, next to 'Star'.

Github will automatically create a new repo, which is forked from the original. If you would like to clone it you have two options:
Within the repository, click the 'Code' dropdown, which is located next to 'Add File' on the right (underneath the Settings tab); there is an option to download all files and save a copy locally.

In the same 'Code' dropdown, you can opt to open the code with GitHub Desktop and work from there.
